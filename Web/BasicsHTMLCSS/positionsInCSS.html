    <!-- In CSS by default the positioning is static which means it stays according to the rules of the specific tags -->
    <!-- Now for moving our elements without affecting any other elements we can position the element to relative, but it'll still not work unless we specify any one of it's four coordinate properties   -->
    <!-- The four coordinate properties of relative position are top, right, left, bottom so we need to use any of these properties to bring the relative position into effect -->
