// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, while Java is a static typed language.
// It means ki JavaScript bolta hai ki ak variable declared hai, now you can input or assign any type of value to it, like let a = bishal, a = 10, so dono bishal and 10 same variable ko de skte hai, whereas 
// Java ye bolta hai ki ak variable, eiis type ka declared hai, due to which you need to create separate variables for separate data type, you can't write int a = "bishal", because bishal is not an integer data type
// JavaScript me by default, variables k andar 'undefined' store rhta hai


let a;
a = 10;       // integer

a = 10.1;     // float

a = true;     // boolean

a = "hello, I am a string with double quotes and I can also be written inside single quotes like below";    // String
a = 'this is also string, character data type nahi hota javascript me';

a = null;

console.log(a);                        // now since last updated/assigned value of a was null, so here null will be printed.
