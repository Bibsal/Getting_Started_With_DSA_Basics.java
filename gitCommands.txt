1. For creating a folder we use mkdir & name of the folder that we want.
2. For creating a file inside a folder we use the touch command(which is a linux unix command)->(touch bishal.txt , will create a text/txt file named bishal)
3. Now I even learnt this new command that to go inside this bishal.txt file and write/add lines inside like I'm doing right now we can do it in the git bash using the vi command( (vi bishal.txt , this will take you/open a new slide of the terminal where you can write whatever you want in the bishal.txt file , this is what I'm doing right now, I've used this vi command and I'm writing these lines from the git bash directly and after writing these lines from bash now you have to return back to the previous bash slide/terminal so thatyou'll do by pressing ctrl+c and you'll be directed to a box below in the same slide where you have to type colon and x -> (:x), and hit enter and this will take you to your previous bash slide/terminal jaha sae tum vi.bishal.txt/vi.gitCommands type kar kae yaha aaye the)
4. I also learnt one more new command i.e the cat command which is used to enter inside any file and check what are the lines written inside that file and show those same lines in git bash (cat bishal.txt , will print all the lines I've wrote in this file).
5. If you want to restore your saved changes back to as it was before then you can use -> git restore --staged <filename> <- command and you will get all the same things that you had previously before staging(i.e agar guest ko photo click karne k liye stage par chada diya hai but you realised that unka pic already le chuke hai hum/you dont want to click their picture then for calling/restoring them back from the stage you use this restore wala command).
6. Now if you want to see all the commit's that you've made, so for that you use the -> git log <- command which will give you all the details of what all commits you made/whosoever has made it it'll show the author's name and at what date and time you made that commit.
